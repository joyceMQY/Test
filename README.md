To use the script testCalculator.sh, please perform the following steps:
  1. Open the terminal and cd into your working directory.
  2. Put testCalculator.sh and 6300Sum14Assignment2-grading project to your working directory.
  3. Change the package names (both the ones under src and test) of the student's solution to gatech.cs6300.assignment2 if they are not gatech.cs6300.assignment2.
  4. Do not modify MANIFEST.MF under META-INF folder in 6300Sum14Assignment2-grading unless the Main-Class and Class-Path info should be changed.
  5. Run testCalculator.sh using command "./testCalculator.sh <gt_userid> <path_of_student_repo>". The first argument is the student's gt userid, and the second one is the path of the repo after you pull it from GitHub.
  6. Result will be shown on the terminal: "true" means tests passed, otherwise the failure info appears.
